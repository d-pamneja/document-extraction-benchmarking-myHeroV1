Vendors, CONSULTANTS, and consultants shall not engage in conduct that has an effect of unreasonably interfering with a COMMISSION employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.\n\n10. **LICENSES.** If a license of any kind is required of CONSULTANT, its employees, agents, or sub CONSULTANTs by Federal or State law, CONSULTANT warrants that such license has been obtained, is valid and in good standing, that CONSULTANT shall keep it in effect at all times during the terms of this Agreement, and that any applicable bond has been posted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n11. **INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS.** CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and considered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION.
